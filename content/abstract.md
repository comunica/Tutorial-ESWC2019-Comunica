## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
*Querying Linked Data* on the Web is aÂ non-trivial endeavour
because of the *heterogeneity* of Linked Data publication interfaces
and the large *variety* of querying algorithms.
We recently introduced a meta query engine, called [*Comunica*](http://comunica.linkeddatafragments.org/),
as a *research platform* that offers a way to cope with this complexity.
<!-- Need         -->
To enable researchers to easily get started with Comunica.
<!-- Task         -->
we offer this introductory tutorial.

<br class='screen-only' />

<!-- Object       -->
The tutorial consists of an overview of the capabilities of this platform,
and demonstrates its usage for *research purposes*.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
As a result, participants from different backgrounds
will be able to query Linked Data with Comunica,
and modify the querying process with custom algorithms.
Ultimately, this will reduce the effort needed to *develop*
and *evaluate* new Linked Data querying techniques.
