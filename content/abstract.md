## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Querying Linked Data on the Web is aÂ non-trivial endeavour
because of the heterogeneity of Linked Data publication interfaces
and the large variety of querying algorithms.
We recently introduced a meta query engine, called Comunica,
as a research platform that offers a way to cope with this complexity.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to enable researchers to easily get started within this platform.
<!-- Task         -->
we offer a tutorial on Comunica.
<!-- Object       -->
The tutorial consists of an overview of the capabilities of this platform,
and demonstrates its usage for research purposes.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
As a result, participants from different backgrounds
will be able to query Linked Data with Comunica,
and modify the querying process with custom algorithms.
Ultimately, this will reduce the effort needed to develop
and evaluate new Linked Data querying techniques.
