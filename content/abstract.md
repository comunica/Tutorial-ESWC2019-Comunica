## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Querying Linked Data is a non-trivial domain.
Partly because of the heterogeneity of Linked Data publication interfaces,
and the large variety of querying algorithms.
A meta query engine, called Comunica, was recently introduced
as a research platform that offers a way to cope with this complexity.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to enable researchers to easily get started within this platform.
<!-- Task         -->
we offer a tutorial on Comunica.
<!-- Object       -->
The tutorial consists of an overview of the capabilities of this platform,
and demonstrates its usage for research purposes.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
As a result, participants from different backgrounds
will be able to query Linked Data with Comunica,
and modify the querying process with custom algorithms.
Ultimately, this reduces development-effort for researching
and evaluating new Linked Data querying techniques.
