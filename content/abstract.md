## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The availability of Linked Data is continuously increasing,
and different _querying_ techniques exist to consume this Linked Data.
<!-- Need         -->
In order to allow developers and researchers to become familiar
with the domain of Linked Data querying,
<!-- Task         -->
we provide an overview of the domain in this tutorial.
<!-- Object       -->
We first explain the standardized SPARQL language and protocol,
together with some non-standard alternatives.
After that, we use a state-of-the-art
query engine in which different querying techniques
will be demonstrated.
<!-- Findings     -->
<!-- Conclusion   -->
As a result, participants from different backgrounds
will be able to query Linked Data on their own,
either for research or for development purposes.
<!-- Perspectives -->
