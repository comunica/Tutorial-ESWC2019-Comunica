## Audience
{:#audience}

This tutorial focuses on all researchers that are active in the domain of querying Linked Data,
and developers that are interested in a flexible querying platform.
We assume elementary knowledge on RDF and SPARQL,
and more advanced concepts will be tackled depending on the competences of the audience.
The end-goal is to provide participants with sufficient knowledge and experience within the Comunica platform
to use it to query, tweaking its configuration, and implementing custom modules.
In order to attract participants,
we will announce it over the relevant querying-related Semantic Web mailing lists,
via Twitter, and directly via Gitter chat channels focused on Linked Data development.
