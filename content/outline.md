## Outline
{:#outline}

We plan a full day for this tutorial.
The morning session will consist of presentations,
in which the motivation and purpose of Comunica will be explained,
followed by an overview of its architecture.
In the afternoon, we will have a hands-on session.
Together with the audience, installation and usage of Comunica
within a JavaScript application will be demonstrated.
After that, we will go a step further,
and guide the audience through the process of configuring Comunica.
Finally, we will guide the implementation of a simple querying algorithm
as a Comunica module.

The tutorial will be guided by slides,
which will be shared online after the session.
For the hands-on coding session, we will provide
a git repository with separate branches for all sequantially completed tasks.
This will allow participants that are unable to complete a certain task,
to still begin with the next task by checking out a different branch.
