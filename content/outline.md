## Outline
{:#outline}

We plan a full day for this tutorial.
The morning session will consist of presentations,
in which the motivation and purpose of Comunica will be explained,
followed by an overview of its architecture.
In the afternoon, we will have a hands-on session.
Together with the audience, installation and usage of Comunica
within a JavaScript application will be demonstrated.
After that, we will go a step further,
and guide the audience through the process of configuring Comunica.
