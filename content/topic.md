## Topic and Relevance
{:#topic}

Querying is a key aspect of the [Semantic Web Stack](cite:cites semanticweb),
and a large variety of querying _algorithms_ for different kinds of Linked Data _interfaces_ already exist.
There are still plenty of open problems
that elicit research on new querying techniques and combinations of existing ones.

[Comunica](cite:cites comunica) is a _meta_ query engine that was introduced
as a tool to facilitate the development, testing, and evaluation of such querying capabilities.
This is the first tutorial that is dedicated to Comunica.
Before that, Comunica was used as a tool to demonstrate various querying capabilities in a tutorial
on [_Knowledge Representation as Linked Data_](cite:cites cikm) at the CIKM conference 2018.
